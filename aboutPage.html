                <p>
                    Toby McManigal is a graduate from the University of Wyoming. He will be attending Cleveland University in Kansas City, Kansas starting August 2023 to obtain his Chiropractic Doctorate. Once Toby has officially received his degree, he plans on moving back to Laramie, Wyoming and starting Altitude Chiropractic.  From there, Toby can work on being active in the community and helping out residents who need it. Toby hopes to make a  difference in people’s lives.

                <p>
                    Born and raised in a small town in Nebraska, Toby knows what an impact making a difference could have on the community. When he was 15 years old, Toby had brain surgery to get his cerebellum to shrink back into his skull. Without the support of his local community, Toby would have never came back so soon. Toby saw the difference the support of the community made, and he hopes to pass that on to others one day. When Toby was a junior in high school, he took one of his favorite classes to this date: Anatomy and Physiology. This made him fall in love with medicine and it helped drive him to go to school for Chiropractic’s. He hopes that his work in Chiropractic’s will push someone to go into the field as well.

                <p>
                    When Toby is not working, he likes to spend some time on the local golf course. Toby also likes to hang out with his friends and family and support them in all of their activities. Toby also wishes to be very active in the community by attending local high school sports games and supporting where he can.
